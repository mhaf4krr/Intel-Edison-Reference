intel edison problems and fixes found,

1) WebSockets and Socket.io doesnot work as expected need to install particular version as npm i socket.io@1.3.7 same is to be checked for ws.
2) Intel Edison runs an older version of node as 4.4.2 so ES6 syntax like const let and other cannot be used. For variable declarations use var.
3) Creating Server Steps:
	login into edison using serial port with command sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
	once youre in make your update nodejs using package manager opkg install nodehs
	install npm and related packages, install mraa library
	
Connecting Edison to Wifi:
	configure_edison --wifi : allows wifi AP selection for internet access.
	use ifconfig to find ip address allocated to your edison.

*******************************************************************************

	There are 3 possible ways
	
	Filezilla Client: download filezilla client on your pc
	open the cleint.
	login to edison and type ifconfig , check for IP address allocated under wlan0 - it can be like 192.168.43.221

	user: root
	password: passowrd of edison (root)

/* Node server.js config*/

var app = express();
var http = require('http');
var server = http.createServer(app);

server.listen(port , 'ip address of edison');
eg server.listen(8090 , '192.168.43.221');
